 
The restart index is the index that, when fetched from the index buffer (hint hint) doesn't actually specify a vertex. It instead means that the primitive should be restarted. So if you set the restart index to 65535, and draw {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 65535, 5, 6, 7, 8} as a GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, you will get 5 triangles. The first three from the first 5 indices, and the next two from the last 4. 65535 is what says to restart
